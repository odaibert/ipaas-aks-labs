# Contributing to IPaaS AKS Labs

We love your input! We want to make contributing to IPaaS AKS Labs as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code, update the documentation.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Test your workshop thoroughly.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

**Great Feature Requests** include:

- Clear description of the problem you're trying to solve
